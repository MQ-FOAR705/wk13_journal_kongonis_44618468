\section{R Coding Modules}

\subsection{Module 1: Before We Start}
\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Intention:} Complete activity '1'.}

\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Action:} implemented install.packages for tidyverse.}
\item{\textbf{Result:} The instillation took a while but as it was outlined in the module, i saw the sideways arrow to show that it was completed.}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Module 2: Introduction to R}

\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Intention:} Complete activity '1'.}

\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Action:} implemented the lines of code for both hectares and acres.}
\item{\textbf{Result:} The number for acres did not change at all. This is most likely due to the fact that its still operating under the initial code you ran.}
\end{itemize}

\item{\textbf{Intention:} Complete activity '2'.}

\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Action:} in the script, i created a length and width variable and gave them values. After this i typed more lines where i changed the values of length and width.}
\item{\textbf{Result:} I proved what the exercise set out to do. I got 8 both times as the script ran through.}
\end{itemize}

\item{\textbf{Intention:} Complete activity '3'.}

\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Action:}type in ?round.}
\item{\textbf{Result:} There are a few related functions that all concern what digits are shown of a number, you can round up and round down among other things. The digits function relates to the amount of digits that are shown.}
\end{itemize}

\item{\textbf{Intention:} Complete activity '4.1, 4.2, 4.3'.}

\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Action:} Answering question.}
\item{\textbf{Result:} The program will convert them all into the same type.}

\item{\textbf{Action:} Answer question, implemented code.}
\item{\textbf{Result:} I think it relates to what was said in the last question. Because vectors can only contain one type of data, other types will be converted to the common data type.}

\item{\textbf{Action:} implement code and answer question.}
\item{\textbf{Result:} It looks like what happened is the top bit of code was changed to a one and this was reflected in the final bit of code. That being said I'm not sure whey this didn't happen for the second line also.}
\end{itemize}

\item{\textbf{Intention:} Complete activity '5'.}

\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Action:} Implemented code script to first find the median of the rooms vector. made sure that the NA element was excluded with the is.na code and got the median 1. Then i created and assigned a variable for houses that used more than 2 rooms. This came from the rooms with no na section that had a input that's bigger than 2. This left us with 4 households that met this in the data set.}
\item{\textbf{Result:}.}
\end{itemize}



\end{itemize}



\subsection{Module 3: Starting with Data}

\begin{itemize}
 
\item{\textbf{Intention:} Complete activity '1'.}

\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Action:} implemented the arrow interviews and within brackets 100, . This returned no response so i did it again. After this i looked and within the data column in the environment section i had interviews_100 there. For the second exercise, i tried to implement all of the codes but it was to difficult to do and nothing happened and the console sent back an error message. With the last 2 exercises, it seems as if i implemented the codes correctly, the two codes needed were quite similar.}
\item{\textbf{Result:}.}
\end{itemize}


\item{\textbf{Intention:} Complete activity '2'.}

\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Action:} For the first part of this activity, really all that needed to be done was to utilise the same code that was used earlier in the lesson except make the first letters uppercase. This was implemented successfully. After this similar code needed to be used to rename the factor parts to be uppercase also. After this was all done, bringing up the plot showed that the letters had been successfully changed.}
\item{\textbf{Result:}.}
\end{itemize}


\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementing User Stories}


\subsection{Results of Utilising the Shell Command Without GUI}

\begin{itemize}
    \item{\textbf{ 29/10/2019 11:49 Changing file names:} I have been utilising the unix shell to copy and move files and create directories for my dataset to apply my shell script to. I continually tried to implement wildcards to change the names of my .txt documents. After multiple failures i decided that it would be quicker to individually change each file within the shell rather than spending 3 hours looking and learning the right code. Due to this, i sucessfully implemented name changes and directory making. I ended up creating a seperate directory for each chapter and had a seperate .txt for each translated chapter in the format t01c01.txt for example. I implemented the code mv t01c01 t01c02 for example. After a mistake i relaised i needed to add the .txt and had success replicating this for each required file name change.} 
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Problems and Solutions/Quality Assurance}

\begin{itemize}
    \item{\textbf{.xml:} After downloading the relevant translations and converting them to relevant .txt documents, i tried to convert them to .xml through using notepad2. I had a success with t01 and i recorded exactly what i did. Following this, even though i attempted to do the exact same thing i could not replicate what i did and i could not find out why. As i could not create correct .xml files, i decided it would be a better avenue to alter my project to utililising individual .txt documents with each translated chapter in seperate directories per chapter and then utilising a wildcard code to bring the relevant chapters up in the shell command.}
